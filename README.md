# Redux 101

This is a basic working, no-nonsense, stripped-down Redux app. I removed all the unnecessary complexities so newcomers can focus on learning Redux (*this app doesn't even have CSS!*).

Many tutorials I found have complex actions and reducers, making it hard for beginners to understand.

Tutorial links:
- [Redux 101](https://dev.to/iggredible/redux-101-48kc)
- [Redux 101 - connecting React with Redux](https://dev.to/iggredible/redux-101-connecting-react-with-redux-195m)

In this app, there are only *two* actions: adding and deleting notes.

Comments, suggestions, PRs are welcome!
