# Redux 101

This is a basic working Redux app. I removed all the unnecessary complexities so newcomers can focus on learning Redux (this app doesn't have CSS!)

Many tutorials I found have complex actions and reducers, making it hard for beginners to understand.

In this tutorial, there are only *two* actions: adding and deleting notes.

Comments, suggestions, PRs are welcome!
